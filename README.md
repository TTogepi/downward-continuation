# downward-continuation
Matlab toolbox 

Please download and read the help document

The toolbox can be used by opening the “Downward.fig” with MATLAB. Here are the references corresponding to each method.

Special Note: Some methods involving frequency domain transformations require the data to be expanded to the power of 2. 

"Expand" denotes the expansion parameter. Since this part of the code is not written by the author himself, 
    the author designed an expand test in the GUI, 
    and the reader can use this function to enter the size of the data and then enter the expand value until size of the result is the power of 2, 
    which is the desired expand value. 
    
The code expands the input data into a new data with the same horizontal and vertical size.
